%TSTBI    Transforms given atime-serie into an grid entropy image for input representation 
%         in ConvNET
%
%               X...............time series
%               n...............degree vector (first :R, second: G, third :B)
%               level...........size of grid matrix (level x level)
%               showP...........show image option (1 show, 0 not)
